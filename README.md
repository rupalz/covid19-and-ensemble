# Study of Ensemble Learners to identify the COVID19 positive patients
The rapid spread of the COVID-19 has resulted in an increase in hospital admissions and a number of deaths. Certain aspects of blood testing can assist us in determining if a patient is infected with coronavirus or not, at an early stage. We can utilize ensemble classifiers to distinguish between infected and non-infected individuals which also leads to advanced and improved ensemble learning algorithms. 

This study involves machine learning techniques that were studied over each patient's blood test reports to testify the outcomes, with the goal of analyzing the efficiency of acquired COVID-19 patient datasets.
